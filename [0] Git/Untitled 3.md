# **INTRODUCTION**

Git is a **distributed version control system** that lets developers track changes in code, collaborate safely, and maintain detailed project history. GitHub is a **cloud-based hosting service** that stores Git repositories and provides collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and CI/CD workflows.

This manual takes you from **zero experience** to becoming **collaboration-ready**.

# **LAB 1 — Installing Git**

## **Objective**

Install Git on your system and verify the installation.

## **Steps**

### **Windows**

1. Download Git from: [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
    
2. Run installer → keep defaults (recommended).
    
3. Open **Git Bash**.
    

### **Mac**

```bash
brew install git
```

### **Linux**

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

---

## **Verify installation**

```bash
git --version
```

### Expected output

```
git version 2.45.1
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

❌ Running git commands in PowerShell with incorrect syntax  
✔ Use Git Bash or ensure Git is added to PATH.

---

## **Exercise**

1. Install Git.
    
2. Verify version.
    
3. Open Git Bash or Terminal.
    

---

# **LAB 2 — Configuring Git**

## **Objective**

Set your identity for commits.

## **Commands**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### Check settings

```bash
git config --list
```

### Expected output (example)

```
user.name=John Doe
user.email=johndoe@gmail.com
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Using a different email than your GitHub account (may cause identity mismatch).
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Configure Git with your name and email.
    
2. Change default editor to VS Code.
    

---

# **LAB 3 — Creating and Managing a Local Repository**

## **Objective**

Create your first repo.

### Create a project folder

```bash
mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
```

### Initialize a Git repository

```bash
git init
```

### Expected output

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/my-first-repo/.git/
```

### Check repo status

```bash
git status
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Running `git init` in the wrong folder.
    
- Creating nested repos (avoid having `.git` folders inside each other).
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create a new repository.
    
2. Explore the hidden `.git` folder.
    

---

# **LAB 4 — Tracking Changes (add, commit, status, log)**

## **Objective**

Track files, commit changes, and view history.

### Create a file

```bash
echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
```

### Check status

```bash
git status
```

### Add file to staging

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

### Commit changes

```bash
git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

### View commit history

```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Expected output

```
a13c2b1 Add hello.txt
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Forgetting to stage files (`git add`) before committing.
    
- vague commit messages like “fix stuff”.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create multiple files.
    
2. Stage and commit each change separately.
    
3. View commit history.
    

---

# **LAB 5 — Using .gitignore**

## **Objective**

Ignore files that should not be tracked.

### Create `.gitignore`

```
*.log
node_modules/
.env
```

### Example

```
echo "API_KEY=123" > .env
```

### Check

```bash
git status
```

Expected: `.env` should not appear.

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Wrong file name (`gitignore.txt` instead of `.gitignore`).
    
- Adding .gitignore AFTER files are already tracked.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create two files: secret.env and debug.log
    
2. Add patterns to ignore them.
    

---

# **LAB 6 — Branching**

## **Objective**

Create and switch between branches.

### Create a branch

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switch to it

```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

OR (modern)

```bash
git switch feature-login
```

### Create + switch in one step

```bash
git switch -c feature-payment
```

### View branches

```bash
git branch
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Editing files on the wrong branch.
    
- Forgetting to switch back to `main`.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create three branches.
    
2. Add a unique feature to each.
    

---

# **LAB 7 — Merging**

## **Objective**

Merge branches into main.

### Switch to main

```bash
git switch main
```

### Merge

```bash
git merge feature-login
```

Expected output (fast-forward example):

```
Updating 1f41e2a..b701239
Fast-forward
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Attempting to merge while on the wrong branch.
    
- Not committing changes before merging.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Merge one branch into main.
    
2. Observe changes.
    

---

# **LAB 8 — Resolving Merge Conflicts**

## **Objective**

Fix conflicts manually.

### Create conflicting change on main

```
Hello from main branch
```

### Create conflicting change on feature branch

```
Hello from feature branch
```

### Merge and see conflict

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello from main branch
=======
Hello from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature
```

### Resolve manually:

Choose the desired version and delete conflict markers.

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Leaving conflict markers inside the file.
    
- Forgetting to `git add` after resolving.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create an intentional conflict.
    
2. Resolve it.
    
3. Commit the fix.
    

---

# **LAB 9 — Working with Remote Repositories**

## **Objective**

Link local repo to GitHub.

### Add remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git
```

### Verify

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Incorrect URL (SSH vs HTTPS mismatch).
    
- Adding multiple origins.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create GitHub repo.
    
2. Connect local repo.
    

---

# **LAB 10 — Cloning, Pushing, Pulling**

## **Objective**

Work with remote changes.

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
```

### Push

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Pull

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## **Common mistakes**

- Forgetting to pull before pushing.
    
- Merge conflicts after pulling.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Clone a repo.
    
2. Make a change.
    
3. Push it.
    

---

# **LAB 11 — Forking (GitHub)**

## **Objective**

Work with someone else's repo.

### Steps

- Click **Fork** on GitHub.
    
- Clone the fork.
    
- Make changes.
    
- Push to your fork.
    

---

## **Exercise**

Fork a sample open-source repo and explore.

---

# **LAB 12 — Pull Requests**

## **Objective**

Submit changes to original repo.

### Steps

1. Push changes to a branch.
    
2. On GitHub → **Pull Request** → **New PR**.
    
3. Provide description.
    
4. Submit.
    

---

## **Exercise**

Create a PR in your own repo (main ← new branch).

---

# **LAB 13 — GitHub Workflows (Issues, Code Review, Actions)**

## **Objective**

Use GitHub’s collaboration tools.

### Issues

- Create a bug report issue.
    
- Assign yourself.
    

### Code Review

- Review your own PR (comment, request changes).
    

### GitHub Actions

- Explore prebuilt workflows.
    

---

## **Exercise**

1. Create an issue.
    
2. Link it to a PR.
    

---

# **LAB 14 — Collaboration Best Practices**

## **Essential guidelines**

✔ Always create feature branches  
✔ Write clear commit messages  
✔ Pull frequently to avoid conflicts  
✔ Use `.gitignore` properly  
✔ Request code reviews  
✔ Never push directly to `main` on team projects
